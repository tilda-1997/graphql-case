# GrapQL Case
This is a JavaScript project using the AniList API and GraphQL, which provides a basic search function for animes, characters and related staff. Filters are also supported, the first option (to define which type of data is searching for) is compulsory, while the rest are elective. 
The offical API documentation can be found at https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/.
